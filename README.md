How to setup your local environment
- Get vagrant from `https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html`
- `vagrant up` First run should take a while at it downloads the VM image
- To access the VM directly, do `vagrant ssh`. All the files in your repo are synced inside the `/vagrant` folder
- If interacting with ethereum, load the virtualenv first by doing `source ENV/bin/activate`
